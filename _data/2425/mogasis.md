What is your level of expertice for Python Programming?
I am familiar but definitely not on par with my classmates. I do try my hardest though...

Not an app but we have ran some stuff for our Machine Learning subject.

What are your expectations for this class.
My expectations are that I'd be able to learn the essentials with ease and to have fun while learning (in the best case scenario).

Any questions about the course?
None so far.
